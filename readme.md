I embarked on this project as a learning opportunity, inspired by a YouTube video from Alex Freberg, widely known as Alex The Analyst. In his tutorial, Alex demonstrated how to use Python to scrape the names of t-shirts from Amazon, which introduced me to the fundamentals of web scraping.

Building on Alex's example, I decided to extend the project by incorporating additional attributes, such as **Brand Name, Discounted Price, Original Price, Ratings, Sponsorship Status,** etc.

After gathering the data, I exported it into a CSV file to enable further analysis. I performed basic cleaning on the dataset to ensure consistency and accuracy. Finally, I used **Tableau** to visualize the data and uncover specific insights, such as price trends, popular brands, and customer preferences.

This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of web scraping, data handling in Python, and visualization techniques.
